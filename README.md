# Acode
Just like popular IDEs whether Eclipse, Vscode, Nano, Vim etc. Acode is an android code editor. It is lightweight and has an appealing interface. The  fun fact about Acode is that you can install plugins. 

# How it WORKS
Stack overflow plugin is an interface that helps the developer diagnose an error, copy the error then posts the error as a question on stack overflow's user question panel. This is essential as the developer will not be needing to exit the app to an external browser so as to ask the question. Received response can then be used by the developer to correct his/her errors.
